# Sorting-Algorithms
A c++ Static Library that contains a few sorting algorithms that sorts int arrays given a specific size. It also contains a description and uses cases about each sorting algorithm. As for now, only ints can be sorted, later in the future I could also add a way to sort strings and char arrays. THis library WON'T have any way to sort doubles as of the current project.
